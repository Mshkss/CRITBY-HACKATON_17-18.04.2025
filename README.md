Mobile UAV Configurator for Clients

📝 Description

UAV buyers are often industry specialists in their fields but may not be UAV operators or technical experts.
The goal is to create a consultant-style interface that suggests the appropriate UAV configuration based on the client's task, calculates the estimated cost, and sends a request to the sales department.

⚙️ Functionality

Selection of usage scenario (e.g., security, geodesy, inspection, etc.)

Algorithm for selecting the model, payload, battery, and other components

Preliminary cost estimation
(If the request is non-standard, show: "Additional specialist analysis required; final pricing will be provided in the official commercial offer.")

Generation of a preliminary application (in .doc format) with detailed explanation and specifications

Sending the application to the sales department's email and CRM system

💻 What can be done during the hackathon

UI with filters and selection logic
